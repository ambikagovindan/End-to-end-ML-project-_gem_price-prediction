End to end machine learning project to predict diamond Price 

Problem Statement
You are hired by a company Gem Stones co ltd, which is a cubic zirconia manufacturer. You are provided with the dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 27,000 cubic zirconia (which is an inexpensive diamond alternative with many of the same qualities as a diamond). The company is earning different profits on different prize slots. You have to help the company in predicting the price for the stone on the basis of the details given in the dataset so it can distinguish between higher profitable stones and lower profitable stones so as to have a better profit share. 

The dataset contains  10 independent variables (including id):

-  id : unique identifier of each diamond
- carat : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
- cut : Quality of Diamond Cut
- color : Color of Diamond
- clarity : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
- depth : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
- table : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
- x : Diamond X dimension
- y : Diamond Y dimension
- z : Diamond Z dimension
- Target variable:

- price: Price of the given Diamond.
